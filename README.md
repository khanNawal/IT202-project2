# IT202-project2
Your client wants you to build a Progressive Web App to let people search for and map Chicago's Movies in the Park for 2019.  
Your app should let users enter some search criteria, then view the results in both a list view and map view. 
Specifications:
●	The dataset page is at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Events/Chicago-Park-District-Movies-in-the-Parks-2019/7piw-z6r6 ;
●	UI should use Bootstrap or Material Components for the Web;
●	Users should be able to search by park name, movie title and day of the week (e.g., movies on Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays);
●	A checkbox element should let users indicate whether they only want to see upcoming movies (ignoring movies that have already occurred.)   It should be "checked" by default.
●	The map should have a marker for each record;
●	Each record/marker should have an info window showing the park information, movie title, date, rating and whether or not the movie will be closed-captioned.
●	The same information should be included in the listing display;  this can either be cards or styled rows of display text.
●	Search, list and map should be different "screens" of your app.
●	Your app should have an about page with information on the app name, developer and GitHub repo link.
●	On subsequent searches, the listing and any map markers should be cleared before new items are displayed.
●	Assets other than the requested data should be cached on the device.
